Project brief
The client of the Webflix streaming service located in Edinburgh, which offers a wide variety of movies, documentaries and T.V. programs, requires a mobile web-based application to support the business and let clients watch trailers or purchase premium a year subscription for a fee of £99.99 while creating their account and login into the system. 
The streaming app should introduce the movie’s/T.V.’s content on the side, which is present. A register and logging, review, and booking section must also be there.
The application will aim at devices and target screen sizes of 5.8-inch minimum screens. The cinema app must be compatible with the most popular browsers with the latest versions like Android, iOS Safari, and the most common Chrome browser. 
In the app, features like writing reviews or buying tickets, viewing trailers, and choosing categories will be available only to registered users. The rest of the sections, like future movies and T.V. programs, will be available to no logged-in clients. Also, they could receive a newsletter (optional). 
This application will have a back-end panel to register/login the user with features like forgot password and collect personal data like name, surname, D.O.B., email contact number, country, and join date.
There will also be an administrator section for upgrading and editing the content with some user data.
